# Greenhouse_CO2_controller
This project is a greenhouse CO₂ controller that maintains air quality by regulating CO₂ levels. It reads CO₂, temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, stores a user-set CO₂ target in memory, and controls a fan and CO₂ valve accordingly. Data is uploaded to the cloud (ThingSpeak) for monitoring and remote adjustments.
